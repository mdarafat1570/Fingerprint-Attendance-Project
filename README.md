Project Overview:

Purpose and scope of the project (e.g., dashboard for university staff management, attendance tracking).
High-level features (fixed sidebar, responsive dashboard, data presentation via charts, etc.).
Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS,(or frameworks/libraries spring boot).
Backend: Java , or any backend technology you used.
Database: (If applicable) MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
UI/UX Design:

Visual design principles followed.

Sidebar navigation and how it is structured.
Explanation of the pie chart (for attendance percentages, etc.) and bar chart for visual data representation.
How the layout adjusts based on screen size (using flexbox/grid, media queries).
Challenges and Solutions:

Any challenges faced while implementing specific features (e.g., responsive design, UI consistency across browsers).
How those challenges were resolved (e.g., using flexbox for layout, using media queries for responsive design).
Testing and Debugging:

Methods used to ensure the dashboard functions correctly across devices (e.g., testing in Chrome, Firefox, mobile view).
Tools used for debugging (e.g., Chrome Developer Tools).
Future Improvements:

Potential features to be added in the future (e.g., adding interactivity, connecting to a database for dynamic data display).
Further optimizations for mobile use, accessibility, or adding advanced visualizations (like a pie chart that updates dynamically based on user input).
